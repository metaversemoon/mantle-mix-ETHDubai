## Inspiration

We wanted to create something similar to Remix for the Mantle and zkSync network and we come up with Explorermix. Explorermix is an interface for Mantle & zkSync smart contracts that allow users to interact with contracts on these networks. It also, allows developers to interact with smart contracts, and deploy and verify them.

## What it does
- Allows users to create Smart contracts

- Allows users to compile Smart contracts

- Verifier to verify the contract code

- Get ContractData for the contract

## How we built it

Explorermix application makes use of the following software:

- `zkSync Network` enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the zkSync testnet Network. Contract Address: `0xbCbdF8dE97c7527b01083A1c0Ad6B92C37A7581F`
and`0x015A40a60d33Cea1d67F9dcFF77b6C93b8490C26`

- `Mantle Network` enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Mantle testnet Network. Contract Address: `0x16d7be29ebc6db2e9c92E0Bf1dE5c1cfe6b1AD2a`
and`0x015A40a60d33Cea1d67F9dcFF77b6C93b8490C26`

- `Cadence, Flow Network` facilitated the process of scaling our application for interactive experiences while maintaining the security, safety, and recoverability of accounts. Cadence made our smart contract development faster and allows for more on-chain utility, we definitely enjoy it and will continue developing it further. Our contract was deployed to:0x8658342b18a59b32

- `Mantle Network` enables our application to be a scalable platform with almost gasless transactions. We deployed to the Skale Testnet. Contract Address: `0x15036E33e8E8f706fd77A1aC550d28FD58432c1B`

- `Valist` facilitated the process of our software publishing and distribution in a secure way. We are hosting our application code in Valist.
* `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.
* `Solidity` for the smart contract.
* `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.
* `Hardhat` for local blockchain development.
* `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into
The contract functionality and being able to fetch and read it took us longer.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the final MVP and how our project went from an idea to a demo

## What we learned
We learned to work with IPFS NFTStorage and hardhat

## What's next
Post updates Upon registration, add a point system for users.
